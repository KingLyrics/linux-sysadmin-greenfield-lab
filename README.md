# Linux SysAdmin Greenfield Project (AlmaLinux)

This project simulates being hired as a **Junior Linux System Administrator** at a company with **no prior server infrastructure**.

The goal was to design, build, and document a Linux server environment from scratch using **real-world constraints**, including:
- NAT-only networking
- CLI-only administration
- Security-first design
- Least-privilege access control

This lab aligns closely with **CompTIA Linux+ objectives** and real enterprise system administration practices.

## Environment Overview
- OS: AlmaLinux 9 (Minimal Install)
- Network: NAT only
- Access: Console / SSH (later stages)
- Role: Junior Linux System Administrator
- Scenario: Greenfield infrastructure build

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Linux system identification & baseline validation
- Package management and patching
- User and group administration
- Privilege escalation with sudo
- File permissions and isolation
- Networking fundamentals (NAT)
- Security best practices
- Professional documentation

## Project Structure
- `docs/` – Formal documentation and policies
- `tickets/` – Story-driven IT tickets and resolutions
- `commands/` – Commands used (with explanations)

---

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates **how I think as a system administrator**, not just which commands I know.
