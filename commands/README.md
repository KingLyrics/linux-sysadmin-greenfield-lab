# Commands Documentation

This directory contains a curated list of commands used during each day of the Linux SysAdmin Greenfield Project.

The purpose of this documentation is to:
- Demonstrate practical command-line usage
- Explain *why* each command was used
- Avoid dumping raw terminal output
- Support Linux+ exam preparation and real-world sysadmin workflows

Each file corresponds to a specific project day.
